## About
The **ERC Advanced Grant 885222-GreekSchools, The Greek Philosophical Schools according to Europe’s Earliest ‘History of Philosophy’: Towards a New Pioneering Critical Edition of Philodemus’ Arrangement of the Philosophers** (European Commission, Horizon 2020, ‘Ideas’, [https://greekschools.eu][gs], *PI: G. Ranocchia*) aims to provide a new critical edition, with introduction and commentary, of Philodemus of Gadara’s Arrangement of the Philosophers, a treatise in several books handed down by eight Herculaneum Papyri.

A crucial part of GreekSchools is engaging the scholarly community in a permanent collaborative review in progress of our critical edition by launching a new open-source scholarly Web platform on which the critical texts will be uploaded and be made available open-access, for papyrological and exegetical comments. The platform is composed by two different parts: a textual editing tool, and the open access viewer of the critical text. 

The repository includes diplomatic and literary DSLs for transcripition with also palaeographic and critical DSLs for apparatuses as well as for a modern translation.

This material is permanently made accessible open access following the requirements foreseen for the project by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. 

## Goal
The goal is to create a flexible environment for scholarly editing critical texts constantly monitored by the community by making both electronic texts and digital sources remotely accessible through a single interface with advanced capabilities.
